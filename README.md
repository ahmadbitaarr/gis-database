## 📝 One-Line Summary

A fully handwritten Geographic Information System (GIS) database in Java that combines a 2D KD-Tree for spatial indexing and a Binary Search Tree for name-based indexing, with synchronized multi-index mutations and extensive structural testing.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Custom 2D KD-Tree with correct deletion via subtree minimum replacement  
- Name-indexed BST supporting duplicate keys and object-specific removal  
- Strict synchronization between spatial and name indices  
- Circular range search with pruning using splitting plane logic  
- Distance-squared comparisons (no floating-point error)  
- 90%+ mutation testing coverage with ~2000 lines of structured tests  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **Data Structures:** Custom KD-Tree + Custom BST  
- **Testing:** Extensive unit testing with mutation coverage  
- No external data structure libraries  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📌 Example Usage
```java
insert("Blacksburg", 120, 450);
insert("Roanoke", 300, 800);

info(120, 450);
search(200, 500, 250);
delete("Blacksburg");
print();
```

All operations maintain consistency between both indexing structures.

---

## 🎯 Problem & Motivation

Each city contains:

- **name** (String)
- **x coordinate** (int)
- **y coordinate** (int)

To support efficient queries, the system maintains two independent indices:

- **KD-Tree** → Spatial queries
- **BST** → Alphabetical name queries

The challenge is not just implementing each structure individually, but ensuring they remain fully synchronized across insertions and deletions. The goal of this project was to design a multi-index system from scratch, preserving structural correctness and algorithmic efficiency.

## 🏗 Architecture

### 1️⃣ KD-Tree (2D Spatial Index)

**Used for:**

- Insertion by (x, y)
- Deletion by coordinates
- Exact coordinate lookup
- Circular range search

**Key Properties:**

- Alternating discriminator (x → y → x → …)
- Duplicate coordinates rejected
- Correct KD-Tree deletion using subtree minimum replacement
- Range search pruning using splitting plane logic
- Distance-squared comparisons to avoid floating-point error
- Node visit tracking for performance insight

### 2️⃣ Binary Search Tree (Name Index)

**Used for:**

- Listing cities alphabetically
- Retrieving all cities with a given name
- Deleting all cities with a given name

**Key Properties:**

- Generic BST implementation
- Duplicate names supported (inserted consistently into left subtree)
- Object-specific removal
- Preorder retrieval for batch deletions
- Depth-indented debug printing

### 3️⃣ GIS Database Layer

GISDB integrates both trees and ensures:

- Coordinate bounds validation
- Insertion into KD-Tree first (enforces coordinate uniqueness)
- Consistent propagation of deletions across both indices
- Structural integrity after every mutation

---

## 📚 Supported Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `insert(name, x, y)` | Insert a city (unique coordinates required) |
| `delete(x, y)` | Delete city at coordinates |
| `delete(name)` | Delete all cities with given name |
| `info(x, y)` | Retrieve city name at coordinates |
| `info(name)` | Retrieve all coordinates for a name |
| `search(x, y, radius)` | Circular range search |
| `debug()` | Depth-indented KD-Tree traversal |
| `print()` | Alphabetical BST traversal |

---

## ⏱ Algorithmic Complexity

Let **n** = number of cities.

### KD-Tree

- **Average** insert/search/delete: **O(log n)**
- **Worst-case:** **O(n)**
- **Range search:** sublinear in practice due to pruning

### BST

- **Average** insert/search/delete: **O(log n)**
- **Worst-case:** **O(n)**

Range queries benefit significantly from spatial pruning.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes **~2000 lines of structured testing** with **90%+ mutation coverage**.

**Tests validate:**

- Edge cases
- Duplicate handling
- Deletion invariants
- Subtree restructuring correctness
- Range search pruning logic
- Node visit tracking
- Empty structure behavior
- Boundary validation

Testing verifies both functional correctness and structural integrity after mutations.

---

## ⚙️ Design Decisions

- `City.compareTo()` compares by name only
- `City.equals()` requires name + coordinates
- Duplicate names allowed
- Duplicate coordinates disallowed
- Strict synchronization across both indices
- No floating-point arithmetic for distance comparisons

---

## 🧠 Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Implementing correct KD-Tree deletion (subtree minimum replacement is non-trivial)
- Maintaining multi-index consistency during cascading deletions
- Designing pruning logic that avoids unnecessary subtree traversal
- Writing tests that validate structural invariants, not just outputs

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Self-balancing BST variant
- KD-Tree rebalancing strategy
- Persistent storage layer
- Performance benchmarking on large datasets
- Visualization of tree structures
